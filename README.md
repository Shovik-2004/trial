# 📱 EduAR - Augmented Reality Educational App

**EduAR** is an immersive mobile learning application that uses **Augmented Reality (AR)** and **3D visualization** to help students interactively explore educational content across multiple domains like **medical anatomy**, **electrical engineering**, and **astronomy**.

Built using **React Native + Expo + Three.js**, EduAR brings education to life by enabling users to scan, view, and interact with 3D models of real-world concepts directly on their mobile devices.
